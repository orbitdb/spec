# OrbitDB Spec

> Specifications for implementing the OrbitDB System

## WIP

Now that OrbitDB is implemented in JavaScript and Go, community members have asked for an official spec. This is the place for that spec to go. Currently, it is a Work-in-Progress.

## Contributing

The best way to make this no longer a WIP is to:
- Open an issue and discuss how to begin making a viable spec
- Corral other contributors on the Gitter to help you out
- Start making PRs
- Look at other specs we could look at the format of to see how to build this one
- And more...

Basically: get involved. Contributors 100% welcome.

## License

TBD. Most likely MIT Â© 2019 OrbitDB Community.
